4)	Preparing a price quote in a worksheet for a client <br>
The client wants to order bicycle parts for their retail outlets. <br>
Adventure Works are offering a 10% discount to the customer. <br>
Adventure Works charges different prices for delivery based on the region that the customer outlet is in. <br>
The client has 4 retail outlets, 2 in region A and 2 in region B.<br><br>
*Subtotal = Quantity Ordered * Cost per Unit <br>
client’s 10% discount = Subtotal/100*10 <br>
Total (excluding delivery) = (Subtotal - client’s 10% discount) * Number of Outlets <br>
Total (including delivery) = Total (excluding delivery) + (2 * Region A) + (2 * Region B)
5)	Calculating profit and margin
*Purchase Cost = Wholesale Cost * Item Purhased
Shipping Costs = number of Items Purchased * shipping cost per item
Total Costs = Purchase cost + Shipping Cost
Retail Price (Per Unit) = Wholesale Cost + Shipping Cost per item + 50% markup
    = (Wholesale Cost + Shipping Cost per item) * 150%
	Revenue = Retail Price (per unit) * Items Sold
	Profit = Revenue - Total Cost
	Gross Profit Margin = (Total Revenue – Total Costs)/Total Revenue
	(to indicates what % of the sales turned into profit)
